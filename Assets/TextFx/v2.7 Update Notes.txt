Please Note:

If you have updated your TextFx package from an older version, it is recommended that you rerun your existing textfx animations in the editor and resave/reapply your prefabs, in order to:
- Update the effect implementation to the newest format, and avoid running any backwards compatibility steps at runtime.
- Test that your old effects work exactly the same as they used to (which they should!)

If you have any problems updating your TextFx project to v2.7, please contact us at fenderrio@gmail.com

Thanks, and enjoy the update!
